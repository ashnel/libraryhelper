# libraryhelper

Library Helper was made with the idea that users can sign up with their library card ID number. Linking their libraryhelper account with their card will allow them to view all available items in the library, search for a specific item, and view currently checked out items along with their check out/return dates. Users can view a history of their activity such as total books checked out, how many of each genre they've checked out, as well as how many times they've returned something late all visually represented in graphs and charts.
